Contributors

  Peter Kovacs wrote the cgdbrc infrastructure. He is not
  longer an active contributor. He can be reached at 
  "peter *at* kovax *dot* org".

  Steve Folta changed cgdb so that the colors could be 
  completely configurable via the cgdbrc file. This also paved
  the way for letting cgdb run with a white background color.
