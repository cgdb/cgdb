-------------------------------------------
Current To Do List (in no particular order)
-------------------------------------------

   o Set the terminal size so that GDB:
      - Paginates after the correct number of lines.  This must be 
        modified any time the GDB window is resized.  Or, should we
        just disable GDB's pager, since the user can scroll back in
        the curses GUI?  Maybe that should be configurable.
      - Thinks the terminal is *very* wide.  This is so it does not try
        to force its ideas of how lines should wrap on us.  The curses
        GUI should be free to manipulate lines however it sees fit.

   o Resizing issues:
      - Resize events don't occur while GDB (or debugged program) is
        outputting massive amounts of data.  Doing a CTRL+W causes a
        resize, however.  Is there ANY way to simulate input on stdin?
      - Eventually... flicker reduction?

   o Support monochrome terminals (vt100, etc.)

   o Support terminals that don't handle the ACS lines

   o Investigate nocbreak problem on Solaris
   
   o Optimize display of GDB output -- it's currently quite slow

   o Add a feature to open an editor using the CGDB_EDITOR env var
     when the user hits ^E. It opens the current file in the source
     windows, or does nothing.

   o Investigate removing log10 function calls from sources.c.

   o Allow the user to open a new window for child input/output. Although
     this is only useful in a windowing environment, it is much nicer. Most
	 people probably only use it in a windowing environment anyways. The tty
	 window will still stay supported.

------
 BUGS
------

   o Open:
      - CTRL+C can cause problems
      - Cursor vanishes when breakpoints are set/unset

   o Closed:
      - DOS source files make cgdb barf
      - Syntax highlighting for C breaks on '\\'
      - Pressing CTRL+SPACE crashes cgdb (see interface.c for fix)
	    For some reason, cgdb no longer crashes, when the user hits CTRL+SPACE,
		the last char the user typed is repeated. The fix to interface.c was 
		removed.
      - Arrow keys still not working properly (left, right, CTRL+A/E, etc.)
      - TAB character messing up with horizontal scrolling (source window)

		o Resizing issues:
		  - Resizing the terminal a lot sends a signal to cgdb to resize.
			CGDB should not buffer these signals like it does. If the user
			sends multiple resizes, only the last one should be serviced.

Nice Features
-------------

   o Highlight GDB window, maybe with different colors for:
      - User input
      - Standard output
      - Standard error

   o Make config file (~/.tgdb/cgdbrc).  Configurable items:
      - Syntax highlighting colors
      - GUI style (size, colors, etc.)
      - Key bindings

----------------------------
Done (moved from To Do List)
----------------------------

   o Track the current position of the cursor in the input line so that
     the user can use the left and right arrow keys (as well as CTRL+U
     and CTRL+K).  If any of these currently work, it's by sheer luck.

   o Scrolling in the source window (arrow keys, PGUP, PGDN, HOME, END)

   o Setting breakpoints via the source window

   o Ada syntax highlighting
   
   o Allow source window to scroll left/right for source files with
     long lines

   o Allow user to open source files for perusal/breakpoint setting
     (Popup window with a list of files)

   o Fix resizing issues. Is cgdb resizing?
