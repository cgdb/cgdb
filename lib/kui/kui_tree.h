 * \brief
 * This interface is the algorithm behind libkui's fast macro finding abilities.
 * It is a statefull data structure, which can be told to start matching, to
 * receive input, and then to stop matching. When it is told to stop, it knows
 * exactly which macro's have been completed, and how much data is extra.
