   The color range of a 256 color terminal consists of 4 parts, often 5,
       in which case you actually get 258 colors:

    - Color numbers 0 to 7 are the default terminal colors, the actual RGB
       value of which is not standardized and can often be configured.

    - Color numbers 8 to 15 are the "bright" colors. Most of the time these
       are a lighter shade of the the color with index - 8. They are also not
       standardized and can often be configured. Depending on terminal and
       shell, they are often used instead of or in conjunction with bold font
       faces.

    - Color numbers 16 to 231 are RGB colors. These 216 colors are defined by
       6 values on each of the three RGB axes. That is instead of values 0 -
       255, each color only ranges from 0 - 5.

       The color number is then calculated like this:

       number = 16 + 36 * r + 6 * g + b
       with r, g and b in the range 0 - 5.

    - The color numbers 232 to 255 are grayscale with 24 shades of gray from dark to light.

    - The default colors for foreground and background. In many terminals they
       can be configured independently from the 256 indexed colors, giving an
       additional two configurable colors . You get them when not setting any
       other color or disabling other colors (i.e. print '\e[m').

   In 256-color mode, the color-codes are the following:

   0x00-0x07:  standard colors (as in ESC [ 30–37 m)
   0x08-0x0F:  high intensity colors (as in ESC [ 90–97 m)
   0x10-0xE7:  6 × 6 × 6 = 216 colors: 16 + 36 × r + 6 × g + b (0 ? r, g, b ? 5)
   0xE8-0xFF:  grayscale from black to white in 24 steps

   Set the foreground color to index N: \033[38;5;${N}m
   Set the background color to index M: \033[48;5;${M}m
